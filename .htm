            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about education
                 is gaining knowledge. Education is a tool which provides people with knowledge, skill, technique, information,
                  enables them to know their rights and duties toward their family, society as well as the nation. 
                  It expands vision and outlook to see the world. It develops the capabilities to fight against injustice, 
                  violence, corruption and many other bad elements in the society.

                Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. 
                It is the most important element in the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore 
                new ideas. It means one will not able to develop the world because without ideas there is no creativity and 
                without creativity, there is no development of the nation.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An educated person is more likely to develop better moral and ethical values as compared
                 to an uneducated person. Lack of education creates problems like superstition, domestic violence, poor health, 
                 and poor living standards. Education brings equal opportunity for both men and women and educated people will be
                  able to create a better society. Without a good education, a better society can‚Äôt be formed.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is an integral part of human society. Its importance in life can‚Äôt be ignored as
                 lack of education gives birth to numerous social problems like poor health, internal conflict, poor living standards and
                  many more. It helps people to find a better solution to their problems. Education lets people realize the true value of 
                  contribution and help become the backbone of the society.</p>
